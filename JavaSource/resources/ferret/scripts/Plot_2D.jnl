! Plot_2d.jnl decides which script to call to make a 2D plot.
! In the "old" LAS UI a 2D plot has the same options and other
! UI characteristics regardless of the view (except XY) so it's easier
! to have one script like this to drive all the others.
! In the new UI it's likely we'll define one operation per
! dimension.
