! Extracting to a netCDF file and some text and table files have different
! options in the UI.  Need to separate them at this level to keep the UI
! happy.  All the Data_Extract* scripts launch the same list_data.jnl script.
!
! This will have a ferret_format symbol defined from a UI option with the value set to
! one of "tsv" "csv" "asc".
GO list_data
